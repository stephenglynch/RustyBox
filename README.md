# RustyBox

RustyBox is intended to be a project that fufills a similar  roll as BusyBox or 
ToyBox. That is, to provide a basic set of command line utilities to run a 
useable command line. 

It's worth saying from the get go this is not really intended as a serious 
project, but my attempt at having a long running Rust project I can dip into
 and learn some other unix-y things along the way. 

Design decisions will be largely guided by Rob Langley's journey in building
ToyBox.

Implementations of various commands, in the first instance, will be aiming to
meet the most basic POSIX compliance definition.
