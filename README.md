# RustyBox

RustyBox is intended to be a project that fufills a similar  roll as BusyBox or 
ToyBox. That is, to provide a basic set of command line utilities to run a 
useable command line. 

It's worth saying from the get go this is not initially a serious project, but
my attempt at learning Rust and maybe some other things along the way. 

Design decisions will be largely guided by Rob Langley's journey in building
ToyBox.
